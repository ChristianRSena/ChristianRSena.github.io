        <h1>Internet Humor</h1>
        <h3>by Christian Sena</h3>
        <p>I've been on the internet for a long time. Here are 3 pages that I think are funny.</p>
        

        <h2>Top Laugh</h2>
        <p>One of my earliest memories on the internet is this (or a variation of) website. It caught me offguard and I sent it to many of my friends at the time.</p>
        <a href="http://www.nooo.me/">Nooooo! Button</a>

        <h2>Snowboarding</h2>
        <p>The only thing that keeps me going during the offseason is this gem right here.</p>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/">r/Snowboarding</a>

        <h2>They Came Bounding Over</h2>
        <p>No matter what mood I'm in, this is always going to bring a smile on my face.</p>
